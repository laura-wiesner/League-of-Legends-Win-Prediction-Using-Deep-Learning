# Project Overview

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the outcome of League of Legends matches based on player data. It utilizes a dataset containing information about high and low elo players, including in-game statistics such as kills, deaths, assists, and more. The prediction model is implemented using a neural network architecture with backpropagation.

## Specific Libraries and Tools Used
- **Python:** The programming language used for development.
- **TensorFlow:** A deep learning framework used for building and training neural networks.
- **scikit-learn:** A Python library for machine learning tasks such as data preprocessing and evaluation.
- **matplotlib:** A library for creating data visualizations.
- **numpy:** A library for numerical computing in Python.

## Outcomes Achieved
- Achieved an accuracy score of 75% for predicting game outcomes for higher-level players and 70% for lower-level playerson the test set.
- Successfully implemented a neural network model that effectively predicts match outcomes based on player data.
- Further optimization and fine-tuning of hyperparameters may lead to improvements in model performance.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks, to predict outcomes in competitive gaming scenarios. It provides insights into player performance and potential factors influencing match results in League of Legends.
